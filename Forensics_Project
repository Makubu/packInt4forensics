Subject:

dpkg -V can be used in a debian-like system to verify the hash of all installed files. However, this cannot be used for forensics purposes (e.g., to find if a system tool has been replaced) because it uses the information in the dpkg database and if an attacker is able to tamper with a system file, she can as well modify this info.
Write a forensics version of this, that can look at a mounted filesystem and retrieve the list of executable files and libraries and the list of installed packages. Then it should download the same package versions, and compare the hashes of the installed file, reporting any discrepancy and missing info (e.g., one executable not accounted for the packages).
Another possible add on (or separate project actually) could instead list all cloned repositories, find the files installed from there and list also the checkout version and the latest commit to the repo (for github repos).

Additional Notes:
- Question:
You talk about retrieving all packages and also downloading them, but it
would take a huge amount of time. Couldn't we just check for one specific
package we would like to verify ? 
- Answer:
yes, downloading all packages can take one hour or more. But that is ok (and you should create a local cache of the packages to check before
downloading).

- Question:
Another question, each time we should
download the legitimate version package and hash it locally ?
Or should we use online hash databases which would already contain the legitimate hash value ?
- Answer:
The package contains already the hashes. But if you find some online resource with the hash of the files in the packages, that would be amazing.
